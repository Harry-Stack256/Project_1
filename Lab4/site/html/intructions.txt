Start this function with the following:
str_cleaned = str.replace(/\s+|\n|\r|\t/g, "");
The code above basically removes any whitespace from the input text that the user typed in the
text input box before clicking the calculate button.
Next, add the following code:
arr_nums = str_cleaned.split(",").map(Number);
The code above created an array called arr_nums that stores numbers. How did it get the
numbers? It firsts split the cleaned string (which at that point should only have digits and
commas in it) and it splits the string on commas (so it throws out the commas and the digit
sequences – i.e., “numbers” in between are to become the indices of an array). As those
“numbers” are still just strings of digit characters and not really numbers, the map function then
converts them into numbers before the collection is stored in the array arr_nums.
Next, perform an in-place sort on the array with the following code:
arr_nums.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
Finally, the function returns must the sorted array of numbers to the caller.
JS function Descriptions (continued):
The function update_stats() does the following…
First, create a variable called input_text and assign to it the reference to the element in the
document that has the ID “input_set”; this is done with
document.getElementById().
The variable is a reference to the HTML element. You need to use the contents of that element,
which is accessible via the element’s value, so create a variable called str_to_parse and
store in it the value of input_text.
Next, create an array called x and assign to it the return value of the function call to the other
function -
parse_string_into_array_of_ordered_asc_nums( str_to_parse ) .
Next, print the length of the array x to the console log (see screenshots below; make sure you
include the correct text).
Next, make a call to the console.log() function to print a bunch of hyphens/dashes to console
log. Now you need to iterate over x with a for-loop an print to the console the values at each
index of the array (make sure you tab-indent and display array name and index number too, as
seen in the screenshots). After the for-loop, make another call to the console.log() function to
print a bunch of hyphens/dashes to console log.
Now your function will do two final steps. First, it will change the value in the stats table in row
one’s column three. To do this, you need to get a reference to that <td> and set the
innerHTML to represent the new list of numbers that are now sorted in the array x. Please make
sure you don’t just put the numbers, but instead actually create parenthesis, equal sign, and
character ‘x’, as seen in screenshots. The second step is to change the remaining column 3 cells
to display “TBD.”
